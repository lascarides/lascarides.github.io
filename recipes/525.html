<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Process dates in a food processor until small bits remain (about 1 minute). It should form a &quot;dough&quot; like consistency. (Mine rolled into a ball.) (Although not ideal, if your dates don&#39;t feel sticky and moist, you can soak them in water for 10 minutes then drain before processing. This will help them blend better and hold the bars together better. But ideally, you can find fresh, sticky moist dates.)
</li>
<li>
Optional step: Toast your oats (and almonds if raw) in a 350-degree F (176 C) oven for 10-15 minutes or until slightly golden brown. Otherwise, leave them raw - I prefer the toasted flavor.
</li>
<li>
Place oats, almonds and dates in a large mixing bowl - set aside.
</li>
<li>
Warm honey and peanut butter in a small saucepan over low heat. Stir and pour over oat mixture and then mix, breaking up the dates to disperse throughout.
</li>
<li>
Once thoroughly mixed, transfer to an 8x8-inch baking dish or other small pan lined with plastic wrap or parchment paper so they lift out easily. (A loaf pan might work, but will yield thicker bars // adjust size of pan if altering batch size).
</li>
<li>
Press down firmly until uniformly flattened - I use something flat, like a drinking glass, to press down and really pack the bars, which helps them hold together better.
</li>
<li>
Cover with parchment or plastic wrap, and let firm up in fridge or freezer for 15-20 minutes.
</li>
<li>
Remove bars from pan and chop into 10 even bars (or 9 squares // as original recipe is written). Store in an airtight container for up to a few days. I kept mine in the freezer to keep them extra fresh, but it isn&#39;t necessary.
</li>
</ol>

<p>The base for these bars is dates – the natural sweetener supah powah. Then we add almonds, oats, peanut butter, and honey (or maple syrup) and mix it all together!</p>

<p>That’s it. Just 5 ingredients, no baking involved (unless you want to toast the oats and almonds) and they’ll keep in the freezer for-ever (that is, if you can resist them for that long).</p>
