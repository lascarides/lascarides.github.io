<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Most Japanese recipes would say to gently clean the kombu with a damp cloth. However, these days, kombu is pretty clean so just make sure it doesn&#39;t musty. DO NOT wash or wipe off the white powdery substance (Mannitol), which contributes to the umami flavor in dashi. 
</li>
<li>
Make a couple of slits on the kombu, which will help release more flavor.
</li>
<li>
Cold Brew Kombu Dashi (Mizudashi): Put water and kombu in a large bottle. Put the cap on and let it steep on the counter for 2-3 hours in the summertime and 4-5 hours in the winter time. You can also cold brew kombu dashi overnight in the refrigerator. Remove the kombu from the bottle and reserve the used kombu (see below). Kombu dashi is now ready to use. If you are not using the dashi right away, save it in a bottle and keep in the refrigerator for 4-5 days or in the freezer for 2 weeks. I recommend using it sooner for the best flavor.

<p>Dashi (Japanese soup stock) is a Japanese soup stock, and it is a fundamental ingredient in many Japanese dishes to create authentic flavor. Kombu Dashi (昆布だし) is a Japanese soup stock made with kombu (昆布 dried kelp), dried kelp that is used extensively in Japanese, Korean, and Chinese cooking. In Korean, it is referred to as dasima (다시마), and in Chinese as haidai (海带). It's vegetarian and vegan and the easiest dashi you can make.</p>
