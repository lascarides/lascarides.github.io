<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>
I just roasted half a pumpkin for a really loooooong time (I popped it in the oven and then promptly forgot about it for a few hours) until it&#39;s really soft. Then cook an onion, make a roux in the same pot (butter, flour, milk) add in your pumpkin, a squirt of dijon, salt , pepper, herbs to taste nd you&#39;re done! The first time I made it, I served it with gnocci, and added some gnocci water to the sauce to thin it then added some broccoli for a bit of green. With yours, since I wasn&#39;t sure when you&#39;d eat it, I popped it into an oven dish, sprinkled cheese and pumpkin seeds on top and called it a pasta bake (oh, and added some pasta water to thin it out). I think I was going to add some peas but forgot - sorry.
