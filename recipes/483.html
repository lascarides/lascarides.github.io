Re the cooking questions: I can&#39;t really tell you how I made the slow cooker stew as I don&#39;t have a recipe. The basic method is cut the meat into cubes, dust in seasoned flour, and fry in oil to brown. I think I used some of your smoked paprika, some ground nutmeg and black pepper, about a Tspn of each mixed in the flour. After browning the meat, I put it on a plate and then brown onions, some garlic in the pan. Put whatever chopped veggies you want to use in the base of the slow cooker, e.g carrots, celery, potatoes, pumpkin. Pour the meat and onions on top, sprinkle over a crumbled stock cube, add anything else to bulk it up. I think I used one little sachet of tomato paste, a can of tomatoes and a can of beans, some herbs oregano, thyme. Add extra water if it is needed, and mix in any left over seasoned flour as this will thicken the stew. Cook on high for 6 hours, or low if doing overnight. You can add pasta or barley to thicken, or extra water to thin, if necessary. Have a look in Rhonda&#39;s book for her basic stew recipe. I also think I might have added some chilli flakes
