<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>
Bring a large pot of water to the boil, &amp; prepare chard by removing the tough stalk or central rib, blanch these coloured stalks in boiling water for 4-5 mins, you still want abit of crunch, transfer into icy cold water to chill and preserve brightness. Then in the same way blanch the leafy bits for about 2 ½ minutes in the same water until slightly wilted, then transfer into icy water. Drain the chard and stems and remove as much moisture as possible by spinning dry and damping out on a clean tea towel. Reserve the brightly colourised blanched water, as this may come in useful at a later stage.
</li>
<li>
In a heavy based large risotto saucepan sauté the finely chopped leeks and sliced garlic in the olive oil &amp; butter until translucent, do not let brown. Then add the rice and toss around in the pan to coat the grains with the oil and sauté for a few minutes, I also like to add a little salt at this stage. Then add your wine and stir over a medium heat until the rice absorbs the wine, now you can start adding your hot stock, adding a ½ cup at a time, stirring until the rice as absorbed the liquid.
</li>
<li>
While you are stirring your rice and adding stock, finely chop your chard stalks and leafy bits, they should be chopped into small enough pieces to fleck through the finished risotto evenly. 
</li>
<li>
By the time 1 litre of stock has been absorbed you should have al dente rice, if not, use some of the blanching water and continue. Then, once your rice is ready you can add your finely chopped stalks and chopped leafy bits. Stir everything so all is evenly distributed, check and add seasoning.
</li>
<li>
If at this stage your risotto is still very wet, don’t add the cheese, continue stirring until creamy, then add the cheese, take of the heat and rest for 1 min for everything to amalgamate.
</li>
<li>
Serve into shallow bowls
</li>
<li>
NOTE: if you add your chard or at any stage after adding your chard you have a thick clug…….add a small amount of the reserved blanching water to loosen everything up.
</li>
